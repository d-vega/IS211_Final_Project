# IS211_Final_Project
Final project developing a Blog web application using Flask.

This Blog web application supports multiple users. Each user can create their own posts, edit, or delete them. I used a combination of Python, Flask, and Bootstrap to put this together. 

The layout is from a Bootstrap template. When a user is not signed in, they will be able to see all posts in mostly reverse chronological order per user.
